    "## Training Your Own Word Embeddings: Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know what word embeddings and autoencoders are, we can begin exploring how to compute our own embeddings. First, let's talk about **supervised** vs **unsupervised** learning.\n",
    "**Supervised learning** involves training a model where there are known \"answers\" or truth values for each data point.\n",
    "In other words, there are input-output pairs so we can directly assess whether or not our model produced the correct answer.\n",
    "The work you did with the CIFAR-10 dataset during the Audio module involved supervised learning because each image had a label.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised learning** involves training a model where there is not \"answer\" or truth value.\n",
    "This is often visualized as clustering data in a continuous space without being provided any labels.\n",
    "For example, a model that takes in student profiles may produce clusters that contain athletes, musicians, artists, etc. without having been provided any actual labels.\n",
    "In general, we turn to unsupervised learning when we want to find similarities among our data, but there is no concrete value we want to achieve.\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is great because the data is cheaper and easier to collect since we don't need to label each data point with a truth value, like how someone had to label each image CIFAR-10.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have guessed, many word embedding techniques rely on unsupervised learning to cluster words in continuous space based on their context to each other.\n",
    "Unsupervised learning proves to be very convenient for embedding words because there is a large amount of existing text out there and we don't need to add target labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: technically this is an example of \"self-supervised\" learning because the target labels (embeddings) are automatically extracted from the data itself.\n",
    "To achieve dimensionality reduction in our word embeddings via an autoencoder, we will utilize a loss function that essentially compares the inputted embedding to the outputted/recovered embedding according to the following equation\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "L(x_\\text{recovered},x_\\text{original}) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (x_\\text{recovered} - x_\\text{original})^2\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we are utilizing self-supervised learning to extract \"truth values\" from the data itself in order to train our autoencoder to produce effective word embeddings.\n",

    "### Approaches to Training Word Embeddings\n",

    "There are many interesting approaches for training word embeddings.\n",
    "Many rely on the idea that words that appear in similar contexts are similar.\n",
    "Let's cover a few different methods for training word embeddings\n",

    "**One-hot encoding**, as we mentioned earlier, is a very simple way to create word embeddings based on a vocabulary of $n$ words.\n",
    "Each word is represented by an $n$-dimensional vector of zeros with a single $1$ in the alphabetical location corresponding to the word.\n",
