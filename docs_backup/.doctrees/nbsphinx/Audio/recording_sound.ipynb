    "We need to briefly cover some basics about electricity.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **electric field**, denoted as $\\vec{E}$, is a physical entity that is responsible for mediating interactions between charged particles.\n",
    "It can be handy to draw an analogy to the familiar gravitational field here: in the same way that a gravitational field exerts a force on anything with mass that is in its midst, an electric field exerts a force on all charged matter (electrons and protons) in its presence.\n",
    "Furthermore, just as any object with mass has its own gravitational field, every charged particle has its own electric field.\n",
    "An electric field is a vector quantity whose direction corresponds to the direction of the force that the field exerts on a positively-charged particle (the direction of the force is flipped when the field acts on a negatively-charged particle).\n",
    "\n",
    "The electric field is relevant to our discussion because **it is the impetus that drives electrical current through the wires of a circuit**.\n",
    "For example, when you connect a battery to a circuit, an electric field rapidly proliferates through the wire and exerts a force on the charged particles within, creating a proverbial pathway for some of the electrons to flow away from one terminal of the battery and towards the other.\n",
    "This slow march of electrons along the wire is driven by the electric field of the battery, and the electrons push one another along with their own electric fields.\n",
    "We typically measure the strength of this impetus over a segment of wire in terms of **volts**, which carries units of energy (joules) per unit charge (coulomb); the electric field has units of volts per meter.\n",
    "A device known as a **voltmeter** can be used to measure this on a circuit, and its continuous readout is how we measure our **analog electrical signal**.\n",
    "(There are a lot of details that we simply must sweep under the rug here, but hopefully enough of the essential information has been salvaged that the reader can still follow along.)\n",

    "The operating principle behind this microphone is as follows.\n",
    "A propagating sound wave crashes up against a diaphragm in the head of the microphone.\n",
    "The cascades of compressed and rarefied air cause the diaphragm to oscillate back and forth in concert with the temporal variations of the sound wave, not unlike how an eardrum is rattled.\n",
    "Next is the critical piece of the process that generates the electrical signal; we will tap directly into the fundamental laws of electricity and magnetism to pull this off (it's absolutely wonderful)...\n",
    "\n",
    "Attached to the microphone's diaphragm is a wire coiled around a permanent magnet, like a bar magnet with a north pole on one end and a south pole on the other end.\n",
    "From the perspective of the oscillating coil of wire, the strength of the magnetic field emanating from its center is oscillating in time.\n",
    "For example, as the coil is pushed away from the magnet, the strength of the magnetic field at its center coil grows weaker.\n",
    "One of the four fundamental laws of electricity and magnetism, **Faraday's Law**, observes that a time-varying magnetic field $\\big( \\frac{\\partial\\vec{B}}{\\partial t} \\big)$ induces a winding electric field  $\\big( \\vec{\\nabla} \\times \\vec{E} \\big)$.\n",
    "Thus, from the perspective of the coil, the diminishing magnetic field induces a concentric electric field that permeates space amidst the winding wire.\n",
    "As detailed earlier, this electric field exerts a force on the electrons present in the wire, causing a current to flow along the wire, and the strength of this impetus is measurable by a voltmeter.\n",
    "**This marks the creation of the analog electrical signal carried by the microphone's wire**."

    "A segment of compressed air will push the microphone's diaphragm inwards, registering a positive readout on a voltmeter attached to the microphone, whereas a rarefaction will register a negative readout.\n",

    "So, **the variations in amplitude of the sound wave impinging on the microphone will be translated to corresponding variations in amplitude of the analog electrical signal**. \n",

    "The astute reader may have raised an eyebrow when they were asked to assume the perspective of the coil in order to \"see\" the magnet moving back and forth.\n",
    "Indeed, this wiggling magnet seems to have played an awfully critical role in our microphone, since it is the progenitor of the winding electric field that creates a current in the microphone's wire, and thus is responsible for the analog electrical signal.\n",
    "If we *hadn't* taken care to view the coil as being fixed, and instead assumed that the magnet was staying still (indeed, the magnet *is* stationary relative to the microphone and the rest of the world), then there is no time-varying magnetic field $\\big( \\frac{\\partial\\vec{B}}{\\partial t} = \\vec{0} \\big)$ and thus no induced electric field... uh oh.\n",

    "We can explain this away by reading about magnetic fields in any physics textbook: a magnetic field will exert a force on any *moving* charged particle in its midst. \n",
    "If we view the magnet as being stationary then the coil is certainly wiggling, and thus the electrons in the coil are moving relative to the magnetic field, which means that they experience a force from the magnetic field.\n",
    "*This* force, then, can be attributed as the impetus for the electrical signal produced by microphone. \n",

    "But this *sucks*!\n",
    "From the first perspective, Faraday's law predicts the existence of an induced electric field, which produces our electrical signal.\n",
    "And yet, from the second perspective there is no electric field and it is a magnetic force that drives the signal.\n",

    "This unsatisfactory inconsistency across perspectives (or, *reference frames*) spurred him to develop what is now famously known as the \"special theory of relativity\".\n",
    "It, in part, proposed that, like [the parable of the blind men and the elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant), electric fields and magnetic fields are actually intertwined descriptions of a single physical phenomenon.\n",
