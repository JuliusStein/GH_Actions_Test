    "In the second part of the capstone project, we want to be able to separate a group of pictures into groups of pictures of distinct individuals such that each individual in the database has a group of pictures.\n",
    "Note that each picture should only contain one person.\n",
    "For example, there would be two correct groups of a picture of two people who are both also in other pictures.\n",
    "We don't want this to happen because an image can only be in one cluster.\n",
    "We will be working with these pictures in the form of a 512-dimensional face descriptor vector which we will generate using `facenet_pytorch`'s trained resnet model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how this problem is different from the other part of the capstone:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are **no labels/truths** accompanying each piece of data\n",
    "- We don't know the possible \"classifications\" which are in this case the people that can be present in the images\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these, it becomes apparent that training a neural network will not work.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is where *unsupervised learning* comes in.\n",
    "We will be revisiting this topic more formally in week three, but here is a general introduction.\n",
    "This learning is unsupervised because the data does not come labeled - there is no point of reference to supervise by.\n",
    "However, this method allows for *clustering* of data.\n",
    "In this case, we will be grouping images using information from the cosine similarity between their descriptor vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how much easier unsupervised training can be.\n",
    "It is less expensive in terms of both time and money because a large amount of data doesn't need to be labeled.\n",
    "In addition, large datasets for learning are not needed anymore.\n",
    "It is important to really understand the structure of a problem and not develop an overkill solution.\n",
    "If all we need is to separate a set of images into the different people contained in the images, we don't need to find or create and label a dataset.\n",
    "We also don't need to worry about all the possible people the images could contain - or training a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Breaking Down the Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the implementation of the algorithm, we have to understand a structure utilized in whispers: the **graph**.\n",
    "The graph we are referring to isn't related to the coordinate plane, but rather one with *nodes* and *edges*.\n",
    "Graphs are a large area of study, and we will only be touching on what is relevant for the whispers algorithm.\n",
    "A graph can come in various forms, but the most common graphical representation uses circles to represent nodes and lines to represent edges."

    "\n",
    "- We want edges between nodes we are confident are related (images whose face descriptors are similar within a set cutoff, which can be guided by a little experimentation)\n",
    "- We also want edges between nodes whose relationship is questionable - as we saw in the example graphs, some images had edges with others which were of a different person (we can accomplish this by having a looser cutoff)\n",
    "- We don't want edges between all pairs of nodes\n",
    "- We want to have a *max* set number of iterations to run because there is a possibility that convergence will never occur\n",
    "- Because the first node and some labels are chosen randomly, there is a possibility of getting different results on different runs of the program on the same set of images\n",
    "- Because of the variability caused by this randomness, the whispers algorithm isn't meant for really small sets of images - think about it like there is more scope for \"correction\" when there is an erroneous initial pairing of pictures in a large set\n",
    "- An image can only be in one cluster at any given iteration\n",
    "- For a better implementation of the whispers algorithm, use edge *weights* to aid choosing labels (refer to the next section)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Whispers Algorithm With Weighted Edges\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the closer together descriptor vectors are, the more similar the corresponding images are.\n",
    "However, in the implementation of the algorithm above, we are only using the vectors to determine whether nodes have edges or not.\n",
    "When a node has a tie among the frequency of the labels in its neighbors, we are randomly choosing a label from among those tied.\n",
    "However, what if we used the cosine similarity in determining which label to take on for each node?\n",
    "This would result in a more accurate choice of label, and in less sporadic behavior in smaller sets of images.\n",
    "A nuance in implementation would be to weight our edges using $1/x^2$, with $x$ being the cosine *distance* between the descriptor vectors.\n",
    "For convenience, we will be using cosine distance, which is equivalent to $1 - \\text{cosine similarity}$.\n",
    "This scaling makes it easier to find images that are truly close and of the same person - try it both with and without the weighting and see if a difference is noticeable.\n",
    "Now what does weighting an edge mean?\n",
    "It means that instead of there being a binary distinction in terms of connection between nodes (connected or not), there will be a scale among those that are connected.\n",
    "The ones that are closer in similarity will have a larger weight, which is determined using the $1/x^2$ from above.\n",
    "Recall that cosine similarity returns a value from $0$ to $1$, with $0$ meaning two vectors are identical and $1$ meaning they are completely different (orthogonal).\n",
    "Using the $1/x^2$ weighting results in a large weight for similar vectors.\n",
    "Implementing this is quite similar to what we had previously.\n",
    "Instead of simply putting a $1$ in the adjacency matrix to signify an edge, we will have $A_{i, j}$ contain $1/x^2$."
