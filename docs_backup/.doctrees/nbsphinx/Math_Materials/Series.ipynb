    "## Sequence Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go into sequences and summations, it is important that we understand the basics of sequences.\n",
    "Very simply, a sequence is an ordered collection of numbers.\n",
    "For example, $(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$ is a sequence containing six items.\n",
    "The sequence $(0, 2, 3, 1, 5, 4)$ is a different sequence, because although it contains the same elements as the previous sequence, its elements are in a different order.\n",
    "Elements of a sequence are allowed to repeat.\n",
    "For example, $(4, 2, 7, 8, 4, 1, 7)$ is a valid sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we define the sequence \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "x = (-2, -4, -6, -8, -10, 13),\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "then we can access each element by using subscripts (which, similar to Python, begin at 0 and end at $n-1$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the sequence).\n",
    "Therefore,\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "x_0 = -2,\\: x_1 = -4,\\: x_2 = -6,\\: x_3 = -8,\\: x_4 = -10, \\:\\text{and}\\; x_5 = 13.\n",

    "For example, $(x_i)_{i=0}^{3}$ represents only the first four elements of $x$, $(-2, -4, -6, -8)$, while $(x)_{i=2}^{4}$ would represent only the elements $(-6, -8, -10)$."

    "## Summation Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to more efficiently denote sums, especially sums over long sequences, we can use summation notation, also known as sigma notation due to the use of the Greek letter \"sigma\": $\\Sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several elements involved in summation notation.\n",
    "First, consider a sequence of $n$ numbers $(x_i)_{i=0}^{n-1}$.\n",
    "We will start our index at 0, to remain in accordance with Python/NumPy's index system, so $x_i$ is the general $(i+1)^\\text{th}$ number in the sequence.\n",
    "We will utilize this $i$ index in our summation notation.\n",
    "Suppose we were to calculate the sum of all $n$ numbers in the sequence.\n",
    "We write this sum as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "x_0+x_1+ \\cdots +x_{n-1} = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's parse this equation.\n",
    "First, $\\Sigma$ is the summation sign, indicating that we are summing a sequence.\n",
    "Then, $i$ is the index of summation that is being iterated over, with $i$ being used to index $x$.\n",
    "We start our summation at $0$ because the first element we want in our sum is $x_0$ (the lower bound of the sum is $i=0$).\n",
    "The upper bound for our sum, or our stopping point is $n-1$, since the final element in our summation is $x_{n-1}$.  \n",
    "This is indicated by writing $n-1$ on top of the $\\Sigma$ symbol.\n",
    "Finally, $x_i$ indicates the quantity that we are summing.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think about this is in terms of a for-loop.\n",
    "This summation concept is equivalent to a for-loop over all integers in the range from the lower bound to the upper bound, indexed into the sequence $x$.\n",
    "Thus, the code for our previous sum is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "total = 0\n",
    "x = [1, 3, -2, 0, 10]\n",
    "n = len(x)\n",
    "for i in range(n): # i = 0, 1, ..., n-1\n",
