    "Your phone is able to do this even though there are millions of songs out there and despite the loud chatter of your friends in the background.\n",
    "It manages to pinpoint the song being played after catching a whiff of it for mere seconds.\n",

    "As such, we will begin from square one and discuss the question: what is sound and how do we record it?\n",
    "This will amount to **a brief physics lesson in sound waves and microphones**. Please note that these lessons do not require a background in physics, but hopefully they will spur an interest in the reader.\n",
    "We'll follow this thread down the path of understanding **the basics of digitizing an analog signal**, which will give us insight into how audio files \"store sounds\" to be played back later.\n"

    "This sets the stage for the power house of signal processing: **Fourier transforms**.\n",
    "Critically, Fourier transforms will allow us to identify what *notes* (frequencies, to be more precise) are present in an audio recording.\n",

    "The process of distilling a frequency-time breakdown of our audio recording is known as **spectrogram analysis**.\n",
    "We will code up our own tooling to apply Fourier transforms over small temporal windows of audio data so that we can view **spectrograms** for our songs. \n",
    "A song's spectrogram can reveal intuitive, and often unique, patterns – in it, we will be able to literally see the recurrence of the song's chorus, the emergence of a loud guitar solo (or some Fortnite bass drop, or whatever youths listen to nowadays), and other key identifiable features.\n",
