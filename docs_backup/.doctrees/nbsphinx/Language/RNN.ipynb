    "## Use of RNNs\n",
    "After being exposed to CNNs in the vision module, we will start working with *recurrent* neural networks, RNNs.\n",
    "Why do we need a different type of NN?\n",
    "Different NNs are good at learning different types of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we wanted our NN to learn how to distinguish between a series of $0$'s and $1$'s that has an odd number of $1$'s from one that has an even number?\n",
    "We can try it with a dense neural network, but it will not be able to learn to classify the sequences.\n",
    "We can try tweaking the NN and how we train it, but much progress is not possible because the *structure* of the simple dense NN is not conducive for learning this classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about it this way: what if a human was given such a sequence and asked whether it was even or odd?\n",
    "Some would count the number of $1$'s.\n",
    "If the number is even, then the sequence is even.\n",
    "Others would likely keep a toggle switch while parsing through the sequence: one that flips each time a $1$ is encountered.\n",
    "The problem with the simple dense network is that it can't *remember*.\n",
    "There is no storing of information about the input itself, so it can't store the number of $1$'s or whether a sequence was even or odd until a given point.\n",
    "That's where RNNs come in.\n",
    "RNNs are good for dealing with **sequences** because they have a *memory* system, which is referred to as the **hidden state**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can train a RNN to classify these sequences as even or odd, let's break down the problem into a simpler subproblem that can be solved with a dense NN: $xor$, which stands for \"exclusive or\".\n",
    "$xor$, denoted ^, is a logical operator, just like $and$, denoted &&, and $or$, denoted ||.\n",

    "Now to translate this to a RNN.\n",
    "The hidden state should hold *evenness so far*, and as we saw due to the non linearly separable nature of the $xor$, we will need to store both the previous $or$ and $nand$.\n",
    "This corresponds with the hidden state having a dimension of two.\n",
    "It will not always be so straightforward when it comes to deciding the dimension of a hidden state since most problems aren't strictly linear like this one, and the precise contents the hidden state will store will not be known beforehand.\n",

    "$y_{T-1}$ is the final output. The $W$ and $b$ parameters, the weights and biases respectively of the dense layer, are the *learnable parameters of our model*.\n",
    "These equations thus say that the new hidden state ($h_t$) combines current input ($x_t$) and the previous hidden state ($h_{t-1}$), then applies an activation function ($f_h$, e.g., $\\tanh$ or $\\text{ReLU}$).\n",

    "The RNN takes in and returns binary data.\n",
    "These RNNs have a fixed number of iterations and are structured like the simple RNN we saw earlier.\n",
    "These will have a **piecewise** linear approximation of a sigmoid as an activation function.\n",
    "The slope of the function will always be zero or undefined, and this corresponds to *no learning*.\n",
    "As a result, weights and biases have to be predetermined.\n",
    "This means that the structure of a RNN is conducive to representing any program, without having to learn to approximate it.\n",
    "As an exercise, we will manually determine the weights and biases for the RNN to solve the even-odd sequence classification from above.\n",

    "## Variations of RNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, there are some variations in how RNN cells are formulated.\n",
    "Some don't apply an activation function to the output.\n",
    "Some first compute output as a function of the current state and input, and then update the current state to be this output.\n",
    "The structure of the RNN we looked at is from around the 1990s, and a lot of progress has been made since.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Vanilla RNN was *many-to-one* in that it took in the input of a digit at each iteration and produced a one-digit end result signifying even/odd (we ignored the outputs of the previous iterations).\n",
    "We could implement a *one-to-many* RNN.\n",
    "An example of a use for one is taking in one image and outputting a variable length caption.\n",
    "Another option is the *many-to-many*, which takes in inputs during multiple iterations and outputs during multiple iterations as well.\n",
    "An example of this is the sequence-tagging from above.\n",
    "The RNN we used for the sequence classifying could be one as well, if we were interested in the evenness of the sequence at each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key similarity between all RNNs is that output is ultimately a function of input and a hidden state which is dependent on previous inputs.\n"
