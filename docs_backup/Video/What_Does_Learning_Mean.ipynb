    "# Where is the \"Learning\" in All of This?\n",
    "\n",
    "The colloquial use of the word \"learning\" is wrapped tightly in the human experience. \n",
    "To use it in the context of machine learning might make us think of a computer querying a digital library for new information, or perhaps of conducting simulated experiments to inform and test hypotheses.\n",
    "Compared to these things, gradient descent hardly looks like it facilitates \"learning\" in machines.\n",
    "Indeed, it is simply a rote algorithm for numerical optimization after all.\n",
    "This is where we encounter a challenging issue with semantics; phrases like \"machine learning\" and \"artificial intelligence\" are not necessarily well-defined, and the way that they are used in the parlance among present-day researchers and practitioners may not jive with the intuition that science fiction authors created for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is plenty to discuss here, but let's at least appreciate the ways that we can, in good faith, view gradient descent as a means of learning.\n",
    "The context laid out in the preceding sections describes a way for a machine to \"locate\" model parameter values that minimize a loss function that depends on some observed data, thereby maximizing the quality of predictions that the model makes about said data in an automated way.\n",
    "In this way the model's parameter values are being informed by this observed data.\n",
    "Insofar as these observations augment the model's ability to make reliable predictions or decisions about new data, we can sensibly say that the model has \"learned\" from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this tidy explanation, plenty of people would squint incredulously at the suggestion that linear regression, driven by gradient descent, is an example of machine learning.\n",
    "After all, the humans were the ones responsible for curating the data, analyzing it, and deciding that the model should take on a linear form.\n",
    "In this way, the humans were responsible for writing down all of the critical rules and patterns for the machine to follow.\n",
    "Gradient descent merely tunes the parameters of the linear model in a clearly-defined way.\n",
    "Fair enough; it might be a stretch to deem this \"machine learning\".\n",
    "But we will soon see that swapping out our linear model for a much more generic (or \"universal\") mathematical model will change this perception greatly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **neural network** ultimately serves the same role as our linear model: it acts as a mathematical function that maps some observed data to desirable predictions or decisions.\n",
    "But, unlike a linear model, a neural network can have an incredible \"capacity\" for taking on the shapes of complicated patterns, which are useful for describing the intricate relationships between the inputs and outputs of our machine learning system.\n",
    "And, quite remarkably, a neural network can be used to great effect *without us knowing what shapes it will take on*. \n",
    "This, again, leaves us far afield from our linear modeling experience, where we selected our mathematical model with an explicit and complete understanding of the patterns that it is capable of describing.\n",
    "In this way, it is useful to think of a neural network as a formless block of clay."

    "We will use gradient descent as we did for the linear model;\n",
    "however, instead of merely tweaking the position and alignment of a line, gradient descent will play the role of \"sculpting\" our neural network so that it will capture intricate and even unknown patterns between our observed data and desired predictions.\n",
    "In this way, because we did not know beforehand what \"form\" we wanted our mathematical model to take, the process of gradient descent takes on a distinct quality: it enabled the computer to discover the important rules or patterns that underpin our data.\n",
    "For a machine to derive reliable and previously-unknown rules from data, which then enables it to make accurate predictions in the future about new observations, is quite incredible. \n",
    "This certainly counts as \"machine learning\" for most people in technical fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks will be introduced in detail shortly, but it is worthwhile for us to have considered them in such vague terms in order to appreciate the point made above. \n",
    "It is worth restating this: one can go from \"performing a regression\" to \"enabling machine learning\" by holding the actual \"learning\" algorithm (e.g. gradient descent) fixed and changing only the form of the mathematical model being used."
