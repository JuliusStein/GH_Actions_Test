    "# Exercises: Exploring A Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical first step to tackling any data analysis problem is to familiarize ourselves with the the data that we are using.\n",
    "It is all too common for tutorials in the world of \"data science\" to eagerly leap right into slick methods of analysis without spending even a moment to get a feel for the data being processed.\n",
    "This can quickly betray the trusting reader, who may then apply the tutorial's methods to data that is not immediately amenable to the same means of analysis.\n",
    "Here are some simple questions that we should ask about any data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the format of our data?\n",
    "   - What is the domain of values associated with your dataset? For example, if you are working with images whose pixels are stored as uint8 values (i.e. unsigned 8-bit integers), then each pixel will reside on the integer-valued domain $[0, 255]$ (a total of $2^8$ values).\n",
    "   - What is the \"dimensionality\" of our data? That is, how many numbers or quantities are associated with each datum in your dataset?\n",
    "   - Is all of our data saved in the same format?\n",
    "   - Is this a \"lossy\" format? (E.g. is there a substantial amount noise introduced to our data due to things like compression?)\n",
    "\n",
    "- How was our data collected?\n",
    "   - What are the scales/units associated with our data?\n",
    "   - Was all of the data collected under comparable circumstances?\n",
    "   - What are the biases in/limitations to the data? (E.g. pictures of people scraped off of social media could be biased towards selfie-style pictures, where the faces are well-lit and are prominently framed with little clutter; there could also be prominent biases in the distributions of ages and ethnicities of people depicted in such data)\n",
    "   - Are there measurement errors (either documented or apparent) associated with the data?\n",
    "   \n",
    "- What are the \"statistics\" of our data?\n",
    "   - What are the minimum/maximum values of the various quantities in our data?\n",
    "   - Can we visualize relationships between values in our data as a scatter or surface plot?\n",
    "   - Can we visualize distributions of our data via things like histograms and [empirical cumulative distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_distribution_function)?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Dataset: NBA Player Measurements\n",
    "This notebook will step us through the process of exploring a simple dataset containing various measurements (e.g. height, weight, etc.) of NBA players who were part of the 2019 draft.\n",
    "The data is saved using the [NetCDF-4 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetCDF), which is designed for storing scientific array data.\n",
    "This data format does not affect our measurements in any important way - the values stored in the `nba_draft_measurements.nc` file reflect exactly the measurements that were collected.\n",
    "As we will see, all of the length measurements in this dataset carry units of inches.\n",
    "Furthermore, they were collected to the nearest quarter of an inch - this is a systematic source of error associated with the limited precision of the measurements that were made.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the Xarray Library\n",
    "\n",
    "We will load our data from the NetCDF-4 format using the powerful [xarray library](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/index.html).\n",
    "This is a Python package that allows one to work with multi-dimensional array data that has *labeled axes, units, and coordinates associated with it*.\n",
    "Where bare NumPy arrays require us to relate crucial information about data, like measurement units and coordinates, via auxiliary documentation, xarray's data structures makes this information explicit and intimately associated with the array data.\n",
    "Thus it enables us to process and manipulate our data while retaining critical context about each datum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have access to this data, our main goal will be to use the [matplotlib library](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module5_OddsAndEnds/Matplotlib.html) to visualize our data, and to glean interesting patterns from these visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by loading our data into an [xarray-Dataset](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/data-structures.html#dataset)"
