Course Pre-Requisites
*********************

This course was designed for advanced high school students who have a keen interest in the STEM fields

It is beneficial for students to have previous experience programming.
This course is not designed to serve as an introduction to programming.
That being said, **students are expected to have completed modules 1 - 5 of** `Python Like You Mean It (PLYMI) <https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/>`_,
**and to to have followed carefully the instructions for** `installing Python via Anaconda <https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module1_GettingStartedWithPython/Installing_Python.html>`_.
It is eminently important that students are comfortable with the topics covered in PLYMI.

Students are expected to have strong skills in mathematics.
They will need to work with functions of multiple variables and have a keen ability
to think visually about functions and mappings.
Experience in trigonometry and pre-calculus is necessary.
It is not necessary for students to have taken calculus or linear algebra,
but some of these concepts will be used.
Past CogWorks students did not have calculus and linear algebra experience,
and completed this course with great success; it did require them to put in some extra
individual effort to understand these concepts.

Interest, enthusiasm, and an attention for detail are all a must!
