    "The common framework that undergirds each of these tasks is that a mathematical model will be used mediate the transformations of observations into the corresponding desired predictions or decisions.\n",
    "Furthermore, from a machine learning perspective, we want to devise these models in such a way that they are capable of improving the quality of their predictions (or decisions) based on data that we provide them with; that is, we want them to able to learn.\n",
    "It should be noted that a \"mathematical model\" need not merely be a single mathematical equation; it refers more broadly to a computer program that orchestrates a collection of mathematical equations and processes to transform the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the fact that we hope to tackle these tasks using this common framework, the essential details of _how_ we solve these respective problems seems to be quite different from one another.\n",

    "To develop a model that can classify pictures of cats versus dogs, for instance, would lead us down the path of learning about standard computer vision methods for measuring visual features – groups of edges, \"blobs\", and the like – within an image; we would then craft a model designed to extract and compose these features, and then give it the capacity to learn how these manifest differently among pictures of cats and dogs, respectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "While this need for specialization can be expected to a degree, it represents a substantial barrier to entry for people entering into or switching between problem spaces.\n",
    "This highlights a major challenge to the field of machine learning: can we identify generalizable methods for developing highly malleable models, which reduce the degree to which we have to invest in the manual modeling process, and instead empower the automated learning process to more profoundly \"mold\" the model?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to this question appears to be \"yes\" – to a degree that we might have thought highly improbably back in, say, the year 2010.\n",
    "Indeed, the recent surge in progress in the field of **deep learning**, which employs **neural networks** as the fundamental mathematical structure for the construction of the machine learning models, continues to unveil new ways in which we can design a model to act like a block of clay – one full of potential and capable of taking on any form – and to let the data-driven learning process act as the sculptor, in place of the human expert.\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of deep learning, especially in the field of computer vision, is what enables us to tackle the rather audacious capstone project from the module: systematically sorting pictures based on the people in them.\n",
    "By leveraging neural networks, we will be able to forgo lengthy lessons in classical computer vision-based signal processing techniques, which would be unwieldy for a module of such modest size.\n",
    "Thus, we will proceed by first introducing ourselves to the process known as **supervised learning**, and then we proceed to learn about the fundamentals of modern neural networks."
