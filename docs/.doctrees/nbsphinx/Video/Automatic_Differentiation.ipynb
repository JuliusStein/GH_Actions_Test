    "In the previous section, we identified the gradient descent algorithm as a simple but powerful method by which we can optimize a mathematical model's ability to make reliable predictions about data. \n",
    "We do so by searching for the model parameter values that _minimize_ a loss function, $\\mathscr{L}$, which is responsible for comparing our model's outputs (i.e. it's \"predictions) against the desired values.\n",
    "\n",
    "At risk of stating the obvious, performing gradient descent requires that we are able to evaluate $\\vec{\\nabla} \\mathscr{L}$ - the gradient of our loss function - for any particular input values for the loss function.\n",
    "With the simple examples that we considered in the previous section, we did this by explicitly deriving all of the relevant partial derivatives of $\\mathscr{L}$, $\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial \\mathscr{L}}{\\partial w_1} & \\frac{\\partial \\mathscr{L}}{\\partial w_2} & \\cdots & \\frac{\\partial \\mathscr{L}}{\\partial w_M} \\end{bmatrix}$, by hand.\n",
    "Keep in mind that each of these partial derivatives is itself a function.\n",
    "We then evaluated those partial derivatives, and thus evaluated $\\vec{\\nabla} \\mathscr{L}$, using our model's current parameter values by plugging them into these equations.\n",
    "This process worked fine for these simple examples, but we will soon find that deriving each $\\frac{\\partial \\mathscr{L}}{\\partial w_i}$ by hand to be untenable as our mathematical models, and thus $\\mathscr{L}$, begin to grow in complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the recent surge of interest in neural networks and gradient-based learning methods has led to development of popular and highly-powerful **automatic differentiation libraries**, such as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), and [Zygote](https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl).\n",
    "These \"autodiff\" libraries are able to evaluate the derivatives of arbitrary compositions of mathematical functions, such as polynomials, exponentials, and trigonometric functions.\n",
    "These libraries can handle enormously complex functions of many (*millions*) of variables; the derivatives of such functions would be totally intractable for us to evaluate by-hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this course, we will be making frequent use of the autodiff library called** [MyGrad](https://mygrad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is designed to behave just like NumPy, but with auto-differentiation added on top.\n",

    "\n",
    "With a bit of know-how about MyGrad under our belts, let's mosey through a thorough discussion of automatic differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MyGrad Bakes Autodiff Into Everything It Does\n",
    "All of the examples of MyGrad's mathematical operations laid out above behave _identically_ to their NumPy counterparts in terms of the numerical results that they produce.\n",
    "The difference is that MyGrad's functions were all designed to provide users with the ability to perform automatic differentiation through each of these operations.\n",
    "We saw this in action at the beginning of this section, in [\"Automatic Differentiation at a Glance\"](#Automatic-Differentiation-at-a-Glance), but that was before we were familiar with MyGrad.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that MyGrad's `Tensor` objects were written to \"overload\" the common arithmetic operators, such as `+` and `*`, so that you can use these familiar operators but actually invoke the corresponding MyGrad functions.\n",
    "For example, calling:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tensor_c = tensor_a + tensor_b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "will _actually_ call\n",

    "```python\n",
    "tensor_c = mg.add(tensor_a, tensor_b)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So that we can perform automatic differentiation through this addition operation.\n",
    "We can read about Python's [special methods](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module4_OOP/Special_Methods.html) to better understand how one can design a class to \"overload\" operators in this way.\n",

    "### MyGrad Adds \"Drop-In\" AutoDiff to NumPy\n",

    "### The All-Important `.backward()` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The sole method that we need to use to invoke autodiff in MyGrad is `Tensor.backward()`.\n",

    "That being said, this is purely an aesthetic choice made for this section; MyGrad does not care about the particular variable names that we use.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = mg.tensor(2.0)\n",
    "y = mg.tensor(3.0)\n",
    "f = x * y  # actually calls: `mygrad.multiply(x, y)`\n",
    "ℒ = f + x - 2  # actually calls `mygrad.subtract(mygrad.add(f, x), 2)`\n",

    "$f$ is a function of $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "Thus the \"terminal\" (final) tensor in this \"computational graph\" that we have laid out can be thought of as the function $\\mathscr{L}(f(x, y), x, y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As described above, calling `ℒ.backward()` instructs MyGrad to compute all of the derivatives of `ℒ`. \n",
    "It does this using an algorithm known as \"backpropagation\", which we will discuss later.\n",
    "Suffice it to say that MyGrad **simply uses the chain rule** ([reference](https://rsokl.github.io/CogWeb/Math_Materials/Chain_Rule.html)) to compute these derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> ℒ.backward()  # triggers computation of derivatives of `ℒ`\n",

    ">>> f.grad  # stores dℒ/df = ∂ℒ/∂f @ x=2, y=2\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## Summary and Looking Ahead\n",
    "\n",
    "The past decade featured the emergence of powerful numerical software libraries that are equipped with the ability to automatically compute derivatives associated with calculations.\n",
    "These are known as automatic differentiation libraries, or \"autodiff\" libraries.\n",
    "PyTorch and Tensorflow are examples of extremely popular libraries that feature autodiff capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"killer\" application of autodiff libraries has been to enable the use of gradient descent to optimize arbitrarily-complex mathematical models, where a model is implemented using the tools supplied by an autodiff library so that the derivatives associated with its parameters can be calculated \"automatically\".\n",
    "As we will see, this process is very often the driving force behind the \"learning\" in \"deep learning\"; that is, to optimize the parameters of a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "We were introduced to MyGrad, which is a simple and ergonomic autodiff library whose primary purpose is to act like \"NumPy + autodiff\"; in this way we can continue to focusing on developing our NumPy skills with little distraction.\n",
    "Towards this end MyGrad provides a [Tensor class](https://mygrad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tensor.html), which behaves nearly identically to NumPy's `ndarray` class.\n",
    "It's main difference is that standard mathematical operations using arithmetic operators (`+`, `*`, etc.), or using MyGrad's suite of functions, and involving MyGrad-tensors will be tracked by MyGrad so that derivatives through arbitrary compositions of functions can be computed.\n",
    "Specifically, MyGrad uses an algorithm known as \"backpropagation\" to perform this automatic differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looking Ahead\n",
    "\n",
    "The next exercise notebook is a very important one; in it we will return to our modeling problem where we selected a linear model to describe the relationship between an NBA player's height and his wingspan.\n",
    "Before, we found that we could exactly solve for the model parameters (i.e. the slope and y-intercept) that minimize the squared-residuals between our recorded data and our model's predictions.\n",
    "Now, we will act as if no such analytic solution exists, since this will almost always be the case in \"real world\" problems.\n",
    "Instead, we will use gradient descent to tune the parameters of our linear model, and we will do this by leveraging MyGrad's autodiff capabilities to compute the relevant gradients for this optimization process.\n",
    "The procedure that we exercise here will turn out to be almost exactly identical to the process for \"training a neural network\" using \"supervised learning\"."
