    "\n",
    "The material laid our here enables us to find the linear model (i.e. its slope and $y$-intercept) that minimizes the sum of square residuals between our data and its predictions.\n",
    "The essential concepts of a \"mathematical model\", \"model parameters\", an \"objective function\", and \"empirical risk minimization\" (as a strategy for finding our \"best fit\" model) that were presented here are all supremely relevant to our broader study of machine learning.\n",
    "The relation of these concepts to the process of fitting a linear regression is the same as their relation to more general mathematical models in machine learning, such as a neural network.\n",
    "Thus we have already made nice progress toward establishing a foundation for studying deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, linear regression is not representative of more general approaches to mathematical modeling in that it affords us an exact solution for computing ideal values for our model's parameters, given our dataset.\n",
    "As emphasized earlier, we will almost never have this luxury when we turn to more sophisticated mathematical models.\n",
    "So, next, we will proceed with our linear model as if we do not have access to this exact solution.\n",
    "Instead, we will learn how to use a method known as \"gradient descent\", which is a procedure of numerical optimization, as an approximate way to find near-ideal values for our model's weights.\n",
    "This will prove to be a very important algorithm for us to learn about because _it is the engine that drives the \"learning\" in nearly all deep learning applications_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we tackle gradient descent for \"training\" our linear model, we should take some time to work with the dataset that we have been referring to throughout this section.\n",
    "In the following exercise notebook, we will get our hands on this NBA rookie dataset; we will familiarize ourselves with a powerful library called `xarray`, which provides us with NumPy-like arrays that support explicit coordinates, labels, and documentation for our data."
