    "## Review of Mathematical Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways to think about and define a function, but at its core, a function is a relationship between two sets of numbers.\n",
    "A function maps every element in the first set of numbers, called the function's **domain**, to exactly one element in the second set, called the function's **codomain**.\n",
    "Intuitively, we can think of the domain as the input to the function, the codomain as the output, and the function itself as the set of instructions (or operations) that tells us how to move a specific input to a specific output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The notation of a function should be familiar.\n",
    "We write $f(x)$ to state that our function is called $f$ and that it operates on the input $x$.\n",
    "A function that adds five to the input, for example, would be written as $f(x) = x+5$.\n",
    "Note that, very strictly speaking, in modern mathematics $f$ refers to the function, while $f(x)$ refers to the value of the function evaluated at the point $x$;\n",
    "we will, however, abuse our notation and instead write $f(x)$ to mean both the function and the value of the function evaluated at $x$.\n",
    "It is conventional to give a function a lower-case, one-letter name, such as $f(x)$, $g(x)$, or $\\zeta(x)$, but some special functions, such as $\\sin(x)$ and $\\ln(x)$, have multi-character names.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can, for example, define a function $f(x)$ that returns the cube of the input minus nine times the input as $f(x) = x^3 - 9x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, functions are analogous to mathematical functions.\n",
    "Much like a mathematical function, we can write Python functions that give instructions to map one set of numbers to another.\n",
    "If we want to evaluate this mapping, we pass the function explicit and discrete arguments.\n",
    "The Python function then performs some operations on the input and yields some value!\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to write the function $f(x)=x^3-9x$ in Python, we would simply write"

    "When the output of a function is used as the input of another function, we say that the two functions are composed.\n",
    "Function composition allows us to chain together functions, which we can use to create complex mappings while maintaining modularity and readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you are the owner of a pizza shop, and you want to write a mathematical formula for what you should charge customers. \n",
    "Specifically, you want to write a mathematical function that takes in the raw price of food and applies both sales tax and coupon discounts to it.\n",
    "Call the raw price of the food in dollars $p$. \n",
    "The sales tax rate is $6.25\\%$, so the price of the food after tax is applied is given by the function $t(p) = 1.0625 \\cdot p$. \n",
    "Some customers also have a coupon that takes $\\$5$ off of their meal, so their price should be $c(p) = p - 5$.\n",
    "However, customers with a coupon still need to pay taxes on the entire meal! \n",
    "In order to calculate the appropriate price to charge customers, we can compose our two functions $t(p)$ and $c(p)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we want to calculate the price after tax. \n",
    "Then, we want to subtract five dollars from the pre-coupon price.\n",
    "By chaining these functions together, we can determine the final cost of a pizza.\n",
    "This way we can keep the functions as two separate, modular processes, while still using both to determine the final cost.\n",
    "After all, not every customer will have a coupon so it is still useful to know how to compute the price only after tax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we first want to compute the price after tax, then the price after applying coupons, we want to use the output of $t(p)$ as the input of $c(p)$.\n",
    "We could write this as $c(t(p))$, but this can quickly turn into a mess of parentheses if we were to compose more functions.\n",
    "In order to maintain readability, we instead write $c(t(p))$ as $(c \\circ t)(p)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, we can write the composition of the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ as $(f \\circ g)(x)$, read as \"$f$ of $g$ of $x$\".\n",
    "This states that we should take the output of $g(x)$ and use it as the input for $f(x)$.\n",
    "This powerful notation allows us to compose as many functions as we'd like without overloading on parentheses! \n",
    "Consider the composition of five functions: $(f \\circ g \\circ h \\circ i \\circ j)(x)$ is much easier to read and interpret than $f(g(h(i(j(x)))))$!\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing Python, function composition allows us to keep our code readable and modular.\n",
    "Rather than writing one big function, we write several small functions, each of which completes one specific, self-contained task.\n",
    "We can then compose these smaller functions to form the behavior of the full function! \n",
