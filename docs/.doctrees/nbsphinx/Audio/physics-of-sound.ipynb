    "The phenomenon that we call \"sound\" is a particular kind of disturbance that propagates through air, which our ears have evolved to sense as an auditory experience.\n",
    "Understanding what this disturbance is and how we measure it will give us insight into what a sound wave is, how we experience sound, and how we record audio information.\n",
    "First, let's get a basic understanding of what air is and what it is like *before* we go around clapping our hands and singing at the top of our lungs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Air and Pressure\n",
    "\n",
    "The air surrounding us consists primarily of tiny ($\\approx 1.5 \\times 10^{-10} \\:\\mathrm{meters}$ in diameter) nitrogen molecules and oxygen molecules, which we will refer to collectively as \"air molecules\", floating around in empty space and bumping into each other.\n",
    "Here a \"bump\" is when two molecules get close enough that the electrons of one molecule can \"feel\" the electrons of the other via their electric fields, thus repelling one another and sending the two molecules in opposite directions.\n",
    "These bumps are responsible for keeping the molecules afloat;\n",
    "the force behind these jolts is *much* stronger than the net gravitational pull that these molecules experience from the Earth, and so these interactions will repeatedly send molecules moving upwards, away from the ground (and those molecules that do hit the ground can bounce back up off of the ground's molecules).\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of this constant jostling around is that, in the absence of any source of disturbance, *air molecules will be roughly evenly spaced apart from one another*.\n",
    "That is, if you were to go to your kitchen and measure the average distance between each air molecule and its nearest neighbor, and then repeat the process in your bed room, you would end up measuring nearly identical averages for the two rooms (if you live near sea level, then you would see that an air molecule [can travel, on average,](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=mean+free+path+air+1+bar+25+%C2%B0C) $690 \\times 10^{-10} \\:\\mathrm{meters}$ – about $460$ times the size of its own diameter – before colliding with another air molecule).\n",
    "Put more concisely: the two rooms have the same uniform *density* of air molecules.\n",
    "We will see that the creation of a sound wave involves disturbing this even spacing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Air pressure\" is likely a familiar phrase to us, although we might not have a precise understanding of what it is.\n",
    "The **pressure** of a gas (or a fluid) is a statistical measurement of the average force with which a gas presses against a surface; this is measured per unit of area of the surface.\n",
    "We can also understand this to be a measure of the average rate and strength with which the air molecules collide against a surface.\n",
    "Air pressure is thus, in part, a reflection of the average spacing between air molecules: the more tightly packed molecules are in a region of space, the more frequently they will collide with a given surface.\n",
    "This leads us to infer that **pressure is inversely proportional to the average spacing between air molecules**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this, suppose that you have hermetically sealed off your bed room so that it is air tight.\n",
    "Now start pumping more air into your room (while holding its temperature fixed, which ensures that, on average, the particles are moving at the same speed as before) such that there are now twice as many air molecules in the room as when you started.\n",
    "With twice the number of particles in the same space, we can deduce that **the average spacing between them will be half of what it was**.\n",
    "Furthermore, a surface will experience twice the number of collisions, each of the same average strength as before, in a given amount of time.\n",
    "**Thus we can conclude that the pressure in the room has doubled**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this relationship between the relative spacing of air molecules and the pressure that they exert, it should be clear that if a room has a uniform density of air molecules, we will find that there is a uniform air pressure throughout. "

    "While we describe the amplitude of a pressure wave in units of Pascals, in every-day life, we more frequently see **decibels**, denoted $\\mathrm{dB}$, used to describe the loudness of a sound.\n",

    "So, if a song were playing at $50\\:\\mathrm{dB}$, and someone cranked up the volume to $100\\:\\mathrm{dB}$, the actual amplitude of whatever pressure wave our ears detected would *not* have simply doubled.\n",
    "In fact, the amplitude would have increased by a factor of approximately $316$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decibels are an extremely convenient measure of volume because our hearing actually operates on a logarithmic scale.\n",
    "This means that if we heard a song turned up from $50\\:\\mathrm{dB}$ to $100\\:\\mathrm{dB}$, we would perceive this change as the volume doubling and not as the volume increasing by a factor of $316$.\n",

    "nor does its waveform possess peaks of a uniform amplitude that recur at a single frequency.\n",
    "Furthermore, the sounds that we hear have more perceptual nuances to them than mere loudness and pitch – the timbre and sonic texture of a sound wave helps to describe the difference in quality of, say, a C5 note played on a piano versus one played on a guitar. \n",
