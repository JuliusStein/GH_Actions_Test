    "\n",
    "Our autoembedder will consist of a dense layer that takes a 512-dimensional input and compresses it to a 50-dimensional embedding.\n",
    "Note that this is not a complete autoencoder because it does not have a mirroring layer to decompress the embedding back to a recovered descriptor vector.\n",
    "We will train the embedder to map images to our 50-dimensional semantic space such that they are \"close to\" their relevant captions (i.e. have similar embeddings - can be verified using cosine similarity).\n",
    "We'll call this trained model `se_image()`.\n",

    "### Training our Autoembedder\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to train an autoembedder to cluster images based on their relevance to textual embeddings that already exist in the semantic space, we need some way to determine if an image embedding is close to \"good\" textual embeddings and far from \"bad\" textual embeddings.\n",
    "In other words, we want to train our autoembedder to produce image embeddings that are similar to the embeddings of valid captions/text and very different from embeddings of irrelevant captions/text.\n",
    "This can be done by choosing a random good caption for an image (an actual caption of the image) and a random bad caption (not one of the image's captions) then embedding the image using the dense layer and comparing the similarity between the image embedding and the good caption's embeddings (we'll call this `sg`) vs. the image embedding and the bad caption's embedding (we'll call this `sb`).\n",
    "We want `sg` to be considerably greater than `sb`.\n",
    "This becomes an important concept in our loss function because we want there to be more loss when `sg` and `sb` are too close (and especially when `sb` is greater than `sg`).\n",
    "This type of loss function is called **margin ranking loss**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name implies, margin ranking loss relies on the *margin* of different between the \"good\" and \"bad\" similarity calculations.\n",
    "Essentially, the loss function works by assessing `sg - sb` and weighting the loss based on how close they are, below a certain margin.\n",
    "If our margin is $0.1$, any difference between `sg` and `sb` (such that `sg` is higher) that is greater than $0.1$ is considered acceptably different, so there is no loss (the parameters $M$ and $b$ are not modified).\n",
    "On the other hand, if `sg` and `sb` are less than $0.1$ apart (including when `sb` is higher), there is loss that depends on exactly how small `sg-sb` is.\n",
    "This effectively creates more drastic loss when the autoembedder produces image embeddings that map images closer to invalid text than valid text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of calculating margin ranking loss loss based on sets of triplets `(text,good_img,bad_img)` can be visualized as follows"
